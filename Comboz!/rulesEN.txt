Welcome to Comboz!

The goal of the game is to find a combination of Comboz. In the beginning you are dealt 12 cards. There are 81 cards in the deck. Each card has four features:

1) Color: red, green, or blue.

2) Symbol: square, zigzag, or triangle.

3) Quantity: one, two, or three characters.

4) Filling: filled out completely, not painted over, or striped.

The Comboz combination consists of three cards, in which, each of the signs is either the same for all cards or different for all cards!

2) Color: all different, Symbol: all different, Quantity: all different, Filling: all different




3) Color: all have the same (blue), Symbol: all have the same (square), Quantity: all have different, Filling: all have different




Found Comboz you get 1 point, if the combination is not correct, then you lose one point. If you think that Comboz is not on the table, then press the Deal button, and you will receive 3 more cards, if there are 21 cards on the table, then there is definitely a Comboz among them, so the Deal button becomes inaccessible. There is a nice bonus, if you find a Comboz in 10 seconds, you will receive a bonus of 5 points

"Comboz!" Superbly develops observation, concentration and responsiveness.

Good luck to you game!
